Code and data for Fig. 31 is available at: https://github.com/alec-eickbusch/ECD_control. We note through private communication that the fidelities presented in Fig. 31 for points at circuit depth of N = 2 correct a minor simulation error that was later found for points at N = 2 in Fig. 2(a) of Ref. [60] (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-022-01776-9). To the best of our knowledge, at N = 2 the results in the revised code (shown in Fg. 31) represent the best known numerically optimized protocols. The modification comes from using a larger Hilbert space dimension.
